Goals:
	- To be able to implement native Datastore API.
	- To be able to complete the implementation for 'DAO' Screen.
	
Things to be implemented:
File location: src/population.dao/PersonDao.java
	This class handles the native implementation of the datastore. 
	
	1. Function: insertPerson(PersonModel inputPerson)
		This function is used to insert an entity to the datastore. The entity is 
		created using the modelToEntity() function, passing the 'inputPerson' as
		parameter. The key and id for the entity is created using the KeyFactory.
		The entity is inserted within a Transaction.
		
	2. Function: modelToEntity(PersonModel inputPerson)
		This function is used to convert a model object into an 'Entity' object.
		All of the properties are added to the entity.
